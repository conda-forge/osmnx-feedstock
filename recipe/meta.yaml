  description: OSMnx is a Python package to easily download, model, analyze, and visualize street networks and other geospatial features from OpenStreetMap. You can download and model walking, driving, or biking networks with a single line of code then analyze and visualize them. You can just as easily work with urban amenities/points
    of interest, building footprints, transit stops, elevation data, street orientations, speed/travel time, and routing.

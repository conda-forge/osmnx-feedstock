  summary: Python for street networks. Download, model, analyze, and visualize street networks and other geospatial features from OpenStreetMap.
  description: OSMnx is a Python package to easily download, model, analyze, and visualize street networks and other geospatial features from OpenStreetMap. You can download and model walking, driving, or biking networks with a single line of code then analyze and visualize them. You can just as easily work with urban amenities/points
